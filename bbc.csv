"LIVE'I may do it, I may not': Trump considers US joining Israeli strikes on Iran",
'What should we do?' Seeking clarity in Tehran as Israeli jets fly overhead,"Fear and stress are evident in my sister's voice in Tehran, despite the crackling, intermittent WhatsApp connection that - miraculously - still works from time to time.Clarity is what she wants from me, knowing I am a journalist with the BBC in London.""What is going to happen? What should we do?"" she asks. US President Donald Trump has said people in Tehran should evacuate. ""Is he serious?""Since Thursday night, Tehran has come under repeated bombardment by Israeli planes, which seem to be flying freely across the skies of the capital. They are met by anti-aircraft fire – which is mostly ineffective.From her window on the upper floors of a high-rise building, my sister can clearly see the action, which does little to calm her nerves.The Israeli military has ordered people in her district - stretching for several kilometres in all directions - to evacuate. But she has chosen to stay.She told me that, as far as she knew, there were no military-type targets near her apartment block.Still, she was concerned about a nearby commercial unit - owned, she believed, by the Revolutionary Guards - which might be a target. She had no idea what the company actually did.Many people do not know who their neighbours are or whether military targets are nearby, since much of the Revolutionary Guards' activity is conducted secretly and from hidden locations.Electricity and water are still available in many parts of the capital, but food supplies are running low.Many shops have closed, and more are shutting their doors. Even bakeries are closing – some due to lack of flour, others likely because the owners have fled.My sister has refused to leave the city, unlike the hundreds of thousands - perhaps millions - who already have, mostly because she has nowhere to go.In spite of jam-packed roads and petrol shortages, many residents have fled in recent days.The streets of Tehran, once chock-a-block with traffic, are now eerily quiet.Those who remain barely venture out, fearing attacks.Recent reports suggest the long queues at petrol stations have begun to ease, and the roads out of the capital are less congested.Residents living near the country's nuclear facilities face the additional fear of the spread of radioactive contamination, as these sites have been targeted repeatedly by Israeli strikes in recent days. The global nuclear watchdog has so far said the levels of radioactivity outside two sites which were attacked and damaged on Friday are unchanged.People are asking where all this will lead, and how long it will last.Many now rely on Persian-language TV channels based abroad for news.BBC Persian's TV service and its website have become key sources. Web traffic from inside Iran has doubled almost overnight, despite the internet being painfully slow most of the time.Trump has called for Iran's surrender, but Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has just declared that Iran will not surrender.Few Iranians sympathise with the regime, but many fear that chaos and lawlessness could follow if it is significantly destabilised.Copyright 2025 BBC.

How the Air India crash investigation is unfolding ,"Less than 40 seconds.That's how long Air India Flight 171 was airborne before it plunged into a densely populated neighbourhood in Ahmedabad in one of India's most baffling aviation disasters in recent memory.Investigators now face the grim task of sifting through the wreckage and decoding the cockpit voice and flight data recorders of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to piece together what went catastrophically wrong in the seconds after take-off. Under international rules set by the UN aviation body ICAO, a preliminary investigation report should be released within 30 days, with the final report ideally completed within 12 months.The London Gatwick-bound aircraft, piloted by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar, lifted off from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad at 13:39 local time (08:09 GMT) on Thursday, with 242 people and nearly 100 tonnes of fuel on board. Within moments, a mayday call crackled from the cockpit. It would be the last transmission. This was followed by a loss of altitude and a crash engulfed in flames.Captain Kishore Chinta, a former investigator with India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), calls this ""the rarest of the rare"" crashes - a controlled flight into terrain just 30 seconds after take-off. ""To my knowledge, nothing quite like this has ever happened,"" he told the BBC.Did both engines fail due to bird strikes or fuel contamination? Were the flaps improperly extended, reducing lift on a heavily loaded jet in extreme heat? Was there a maintenance error during engine servicing? Or did an inadvertent crew action cut off fuel to both engines?Investigators will be probing all these possibilities - and more. Air crash investigations rely on triangulation and elimination - matching physical evidence from the wreckage with recorded aircraft performance data to build a coherent picture of what went wrong.Every scorched cable, damaged turbine blade, aeroplane maintenance log, and signals and sounds from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders - the so-called ""black box"" - will be examined. The BBC spoke to accident experts to understand how the investigation will proceed.Critically, the first clues on the ground may come from the wreckage of the two engines, at least three investigators said.""You can tell from the damage whether the engines were generating power at impact - turbines fracture differently when spinning at high speed,"" says Peter Goelz, a former managing director of US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). ""That's the first clue to what went wrong."" Turbines are crucial rotating components that play a key role in extracting energy to generate thrust.""If the engines weren't producing power, investigators have a serious case on their hands - and the focus will shift sharply to the cockpit.""What happened in the cockpit will be revealed by the Boeing 787's Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - or the ""black boxes"" - which, investigators say, will help tell the story. (Indian officials say the recorders have been recovered from the crash site.)These devices capture extensive flight data and cockpit audio - from pilot radio calls to ambient cockpit sounds. Voice recordings come from individual pilot mics, radio transmissions and an area microphone that picks up background noise in the cockpit.Data recorders track with high precision the position of gear and flap levers, thrust settings, engine performance, fuel flow and even fire handle activation. ""If the flight data recorder shows the engines were making full power, then the attention will move to the flaps and slats. If they are found to be extended as needed, then it becomes a very difficult investigation,"" says Mr Goelz. Flaps and slats increase lift at lower speeds, helping an aircraft take off and land safely by allowing it to fly slower without stalling.""If [the trail leads] to a problem in the flight management control system, that would raise serious concerns - not just for Boeing, but for the entire aviation industry.""The Boeing 787's flight management control system is a highly automated suite that manages navigation, performance and guidance. It integrates data from a number of sensors to optimise the aircraft's flight path and fuel efficiency.With over 1,100 Boeing 787s flying worldwide since 2011, investigators must determine whether this was a systemic issue that could affect the global fleet - or a one-off failure unique to this flight, experts say. ""If it points to a system problem, then the regulatory bodies have to make some tough decisions very quickly,"" says Mr Goelz.So far, there is no indication of fault on anyone's part. India's civil aviation ministry said on Tuesday that a recent inspection of Air India's Boeing 787 fleet - 24 of 33 aircraft have been checked so far - ""did not reveal any major safety concern,"" adding that the planes and maintenance systems complied with existing standards.Boeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said on 12 June:  ""Boeing will defer to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) for information on Air India Flight 171, in line with UN ICAO protocol.""Decoding of the data at the AAIB lab in Delhi will be led by Indian investigators, with experts from Boeing, engine-maker GE, Air India and Indian regulators. Investigators from the NTSB and UK will also be participating.""In my experience, teams can usually determine what happened fairly quickly,"" Mr Goelz says. ""But understanding why it happened can take much longer.""The wreckage may yield other clues. ""Every part - wire, nut, bolt - will be meticulously collected,"" says Mr Chinta. Typically, wreckage is moved to a nearby hangar or secure facility, laid out to identify the nose, tail and wingtips, and then pieced together. In this case, depending on what the flight data and voice recorders reveal, a full reconstruction may not be necessary, investigators say.The importance of wreckage varies by accident, say investigators. For Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, shot down over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, it was crucial -  reconstruction of the nose revealed clear shrapnel damage from a Russia-made missile.In the wreckage, investigators will also examine fuel filters, lines, valves and residual fuel to check for contamination - something that's easy to detect or rule out, a crash investigator who preferred to remain unnamed, said. Also, he believed that the refuelling equipment used before departure ""has likely been quarantined and already inspected"".That's not all. Investigators will gather maintenance and fault history records from the airline and Boeing's ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting system) which transmits data via radio or satellite to both Boeing and Air India, says Mr Chinta.They will review all flights operated by the aircraft and the crew over recent months, along with the technical log of pilot-reported faults and corrective actions taken before release of aircraft to service.Investigators will also examine pilot licences, training records, simulator performance and instructor remarks - including how pilots handled scenarios like engine failures in advanced flight simulators. ""I reckon Air India would have already provided these records to the investigation team,"" says Mr Chinta.Investigators will review the service history of all components of the aircraft that were removed and replaced, examining reported defects for any recurring issues - or signs of problems that could have affected this flight.""These investigations are extraordinarily complex. They take time, but there will be early indicators of what likely went wrong,"" says Mr Goelz.A big reason is how far technology has come. ""One of the first accidents I investigated in 1994 had a flight data recorder tracking just four parameters,"" he says.""Today's recorders capture hundreds - if not thousands - every second. That alone has transformed the way we investigate crashes.""Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Lawyer who defended drug lord 'El Chapo' elected as judge,"A former defence lawyer for the jailed drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán has been elected as a judge in Mexico's first-ever judicial elections.Tallies published on Tuesday showed that Silvia Delgado had won enough votes to secure a position as a local criminal judge in the city of Ciudad Juárez, on the US-Mexico border. Her candidacy was one of the most controversial in the election held on 1 June. A leading transparency organisation accused Delgado of being one of several candidates with alleged links to organised crime on the ballot sheet, an accusation she dismissed vehemently, arguing that she had simply been doing her job by defending El Chapo.The 51-year-old lawyer was part of the defence team for El Chapo before the notorious drug lord was extradited from Mexico to the United States in 2017.The leader of the Sinaloa cartel was found guilty of drug trafficking in 2019 and is serving a life sentence in a supermax prison in Colorado. In an interview with the BBC ahead of the election, Delgado argued that El Chapo was entitled to legal counsel and dismissed suggestions of a conflict of interest, should she be elected as a judge.Following the publication of the voting tally on Tuesday, Delgado said she would refrain from commenting until her win had been officially confirmed. The judicial election was the first of its kind to be held in Mexico following a radical reform brought in by the governing Morena party.Its backers said electing judges - including Supreme Court justices - in a direct vote would make the judiciary more democratic and beholden to voters.But its critics argued that it undermined the independence of the judiciary.Turnout was low at 13% - the lowest in any federal vote held in Mexico - which many observers said showed that there was little enthusiasm among Mexicans for choosing judges directly.However, President Claudia Sheinbaum said the election had been a resounding success.

Trump's Iran dilemma exposes bitter split in president's circle,"The dilemma of whether the US should join Israel in attacking Iran, or stay out of the offensive altogether, has exposed divisions among US President Donald Trump's supporters.The Republican president is considering helping target the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities, following a meeting with his national security advisers in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday.On the campaign trail, Trump often railed against ""stupid endless wars"" in the Middle East, but also maintained that Iran ""can't have a nuclear weapon"".The possibility that he might draw the US into another foreign entanglement has pitted the isolationist and hawkish wings of his party bitterly against one another.Among those that have expressed doubt about Iran's nuclear plans are Trump's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who in March testified before Congress that while Iran's enriched uranium was at an all-time high, experts did not believe it was working on a nuclear weapon. On 10 June - just three days before Israeli strikes on Iran began - Gabbard also posted a video in which she warned that ""political elite and warmongers"" were ""carelessly fomenting fear and tensions"" that risked putting the world ""on the brink of nuclear annihilation"". Gabbard's video and prior comments reportedly opened a rift between her and Trump, who US news outlet Politico reported ""became incensed"" at the video. ""I don't care what she said,"" Trump told reporters when asked about her earlier comments before Congress. ""I think they were very close to having a weapon.""She later accused the media of taking her prior comments out of context, telling CNN that she is on ""the same page"" as Trump. Gabbard was not alone among Republicans in criticising potential US involvement in the conflict. On Tuesday, conservative Republican congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky sided with Democrats to introduce a bill that would block Trump from engaging US forces in ""unauthorised hostilities"" with Iran without congressional approval.""This is not our war. Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our Constitution,"" Massie posted on X.Several proponents of Trump's ""America First"" doctrine pointed out that he vowed to keep the US out of ""forever wars"" such as those that led to the deaths of thousands of US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has called for the US to stay out of the conflict with Iran.On his podcast, he lambasted Republican ""warmongers"", provoking a rebuke from Trump, who called Carlson ""kooky"".Georgia congresswoman and Trump loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene leapt to Carlson's defence in a highly unusual break with the president.She said anyone who supported such an intervention was not ""America First"".The tensions exploded into a shouting match on Tuesday during an interview between Carlson and hawkish Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Cruz became defensive when asked if he knew the population and ethnic mix of Iran.Carlson said: ""You're a senator who's calling for the overthrow of the government and you don't know anything about the country!""Cruz retorted: ""No, you don't know anything about the country!""Steve Bannon, Trump's former political strategist, argued on Carlson's podcast that allowing the ""deep state"" to drive the US into a war with Iran would ""blow up"" the coalition of Trump supporters.""If we get sucked into this war, which inexorably looks like it's going to happen on the combat side, it's going to not just blow up the coalition, it's also going to thwart the most important thing, which is the deportation of the illegal alien invaders who are here,"" he said.On Wednesday, however, Bannon seemed to slightly soften his tone, telling attendees at a Christian Science Monitor event that the MAGA wing of his supporters would trust his judgement if he decided to commit US forces to the conflict. ""Maybe we hate it but you know, we'll get on board."" he said. Another conservative political commentator, Charlie Kirk - who describes himself as closer to the ""isolationist"" side of the debate - said on X that Trump is ""pragmatic"" and values ""common sense"". ""I don't know if President Trump will choose to involve America against Iran,"" Kirk wrote. ""But he is a man I trust to be making that decision."" Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell said it had ""been kind of a bad week for the isolationists"" in the party.""What's happening here is some of the isolationist movement led by Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon are distressed we may be helping the Israelis defeat the Iranians,"" McConnell told CNN.Other warhawks in the party are egging on Trump to target Iran.South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said it was in the national security interests of the US to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Tehran maintains its nuclear programme is for peaceful, civilian purposes such as energy.""President Trump understands the threat the ayatollah [Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei] presents to us, not just Israel, and that he will, at the end of the day, help Israel finish the job,"" Graham told Fox News.Vice-President JD Vance, seeking to bridge the divide, said in a social media post that Trump ""may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment"".""That decision ultimately belongs to the president,"" he added. ""And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy.""An opinion poll in recent days indicates Trump voters would broadly support the US in helping Israel to attack Iran.The survey by Gray House found that 79% of respondents would back the US providing offensive weapons for Israel to strike Iranian military targets. Some 89% were concerned about Iran obtaining atomic bombs.On Trump's Truth Social social media platform, however, many expressed concern that the US could again find itself embroiled in a Middle Eastern conflict thousands of miles away. ""No war with Iran. No more foreign wars,"" one user wrote. ""America first!""Another user warned that US involvement in Israeli operations could cost the Republicans politically in the years ahead.""Don't do this,"" the user wrote. ""Republicans will never win again if you do this.""While campaigning for the White House in September, Trump said: ""We will quickly restore stability in the Middle East. And we will return the world to peace.""With the Iran-Israel conflict on a knife-edge, the question of whether the US president is an isolationist or an interventionist may be answered sooner rather than later.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Trump weighs joining Iran strikes after calling for 'unconditional surrender',"US President Donald Trump is considering whether to join Israel's strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, as the conflict continues for a sixth day and angry rhetoric ramps up between all sides.American strikes could involve using superior weaponry to hit an underground nuclear site at Fordo, according to five sources who spoke to the BBC's US partner CBS News.The president met with his national security team on Tuesday to discuss next steps.Israel and Iran have exchanged deadly strikes since Friday. Analysts say Trump's comments suggests a willingness to join the Israelis, despite his earlier call for de-escalation and his vocal support for a diplomatic solution to limit Iran's nuclear research.He has shown increasing frustration over a perceived lack of progress to secure a new deal that would be aimed at preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Trump pulled out of a previous accord with Iran during his first term.In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump threatened Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and said the US knew where he was.""He is an easy target, but is safe there,"" Trump wrote. ""We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.""Another post from Trump simply read: ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!"" On Wednesday, Iran's supreme leader responded to the comments directly and said the country would never surrender.""Any form of US military intervention will undoubtedly be met with irreparable harm,"" Khamenei said.""Wise people who know Iran, its people, and its history never speak to this nation in the language of threats, because Iranians are not those who surrender,"" he added.The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons - although Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful.Trump pulled out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018. After returning to office, he dispatched negotiators to try to reach a new agreement with the Middle Eastern nation, without a breakthrough.Trump appears to have cooled on traditional diplomacy in recent days. On Tuesday, while travelling back to the US from a G7 summit in Canada, he said he was ""not too much in the mood to negotiate with Iran"".Trump's frustrated language implied that he was crossing a threshold that would be ""very difficult to row back from"", Professor Amnon Aran, an Israeli foreign policy expert, told BBC Radio 5 Live.""We're definitely the closest we have been"" to a US entry in the conflict since it began, he added.Other pundits suggested Trump could be forced into action. A former Israeli ambassador to the US, Michael Oren, speculated that the president would feel he had little choice but to intervene if Iran attacked a US ship or base.However, such an attack  might also be an Iranian tactic to prompt Trump to pressurise Israel into negotiating an end to the fighting, Mr Oren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Trump himself told reporters on his return from the G7 that his goal was ""an end, a real end, not a ceasefire"". His comments came just hours after he joined other leaders in the Western alliance in issuing a statement that called for de-escalation in the Middle East. Trump left the summit early to respond to the crisis from Washington, before a series of statements left observers unclear which way he might choose to go. A message urging Iranians to evacuate Tehran similarly caused a flurry of speculation, as well as anxiety in the Iranian capital itself.US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier announced the ""deployment of additional capabilities"" to the Middle East to enhance the Pentagon's ""defensive posture"", despite US officials' denial at the time that they were joining the military action.At least 30 US military planes have been moved from bases in America to Europe over the past three days, flight tracking data reviewed by BBC Verify has shown.It was unclear whether the US movements were directly connected to the Israel-Iran conflict, but one expert said the tanker aircraft flights were ""highly unusual"".Another expert said that the movements could be part of a broader policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" aimed at influencing Iran to make concessions.Signing up to Israeli military action does not have full agreement from Trump's closest advisers, CBS reported. But the dissenting voices have not gone public. There are also a wide range of views within Trump's supporter base. The Republican ran for re-election on the basis that he would disentangle America from conflicts overseas, and he has previously criticised US intervention in the Middle East.On the question of Iran's capacity to build a nuclear weapon, there appears to be a differing assessment by Trump and his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Asked on Tuesday about Gabbard's earlier suggestion that Iran was not working on a nuclear warhead, Trump replied: ""I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having one.""  Advisers to both Trump and Gabbard later denied the pair disagreed on the issue.There were no deaths overnight from Tuesday into Wednesday in Israel from Iranian missile attacks.And more than 50 Israeli fighter jets conducted operations in Iran overnight, with strikes on an Iranian centrifuge facility, a missile production facility near Tehran, and a university linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards.Israel is America's main partner in the Middle East, and Trump has continued to stand by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid widespread international condemnation of Israel's military actions in Gaza following the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Lone Air India survivor carries coffin of brother killed in crash,"The British man who was the sole survivor of last week's Air India plane crash has helped lay his brother to rest at a funeral in western India.Vishwashkumar Ramesh's brother Ajay was also on the ill-fated flight but did not survive the tragedy.A visibly upset Ramesh was one of the pall bearers who carried his brother's coffin to the crematorium in the town of Diu, his arm and face still covered in white bandages. He's spent most of the past five days in hospital.The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner crashed seconds after taking off on Thursday from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad. At least 270 people were killed, most of them passengers.Mr Ramesh's mother walked with the coffin in a blue sari along with other mourners, as he held it on his right shoulder.Several people from the town - which lost 14 other people to the crash - came out for the funeral even as the rain lashed the procession.No one is clear how Mr Ramesh managed to survive. He even tried to go back to the blazing plane to search for his brother, one of the first responders at the scene told the BBC. In a new video that emerged earlier this week, ambulance driver Satinder Singh Sandhu is the man seen guiding Mr Ramesh to safety as he walks out of the crash site with flames and thick smoke billowing into the air behind him.Mr Sandhu, a supervisor with the emergency ambulance services in Ahmedabad, says he had no idea who he was helping, or that Mr Ramesh had escaped from the plane. He only found out later that day on the news that the man was the sole survivor of the crash. Vishwashkumar Ramesh, 40, was in seat 11A on the flight. His brother is reported to have been sitting a few seats away.All other passengers and crew were killed and nearly 30 people also died on the ground after the plane hurtled down and crashed into a doctor's hostel. But Mr Ramesh miraculously survived, managing to get out of the wreckage through an opening in the fuselage.The new video shows Mr Sandhu, who's wearing a blue turban, walk up to Mr Ramesh and guide him to safety.Mr Sandhu said he was having lunch with his colleagues when he first noticed a ""massive fire with thick smoke rising into the sky"".""At first, we thought it might be a car accident or a gas cylinder blast. Soon, we learned it was a plane crash. I immediately instructed my team to bring an ambulance, and rushed to the site.""Speaking to BBC Gujarati, Mr Sandhu said that he was just trying to do his job. In his decades-long career, he said he had encountered many challenging situations.But what surprised him that day was how Mr Ramesh, after being rescued, kept trying to go back to the site of the crash.""He had no idea what he was doing. He kept going in and out of the complex. We told him to stop, and dragged him away to an ambulance so that he could receive medical care,"" Mr Sandhu said.""That's when he said to me that his relative was trapped inside and he wanted to go save him. We did not speak a word after that.""Mr Ramesh later told India's DD News that he was trying to go look for Ajay.At the scene, Mr Sandhu spotted a security guard who seemed to have been injured in the impact. His clothes were partially burnt and Mr Sandhu first helped him.""I also saw a woman. She was screaming in horror. Her son who ran a tea stall had been killed in the crash.""Moments later he saw Mr Ramesh emerge from the crash site in a white shirt.He had injuries on his face and burns on his arms and looked visibly upset, Mr Sandhu said.""At that point, we had no idea who the injured man was. I thought he was one of the doctors who lived in the college. Later, when we saw the news, we realised he was the lone survivor of the crash.""Chirag, a member of Mr Sandhu's ambulance team, told PTI news agency that Mr Ramesh was telling someone on a video call that his relatives were at the crash site.The first responders treated him for his injuries and rushed him to the trauma centre of a hospital nearby.In his interview with DD News, Mr Ramesh had said he could not believe that he came out of the wreckage alive.""For a moment, I felt like I was going to die too, but when I opened my eyes and looked around, I realised I was alive.""I still can't believe how I survived. I walked out of the rubble.""The cause of the crash is not yet known. Officials are trying to decode the cockpit voice and flight data recorders - collectively known as the black box - recovered from the wreckage to piece together what happened.Additional reporting by Zoya Mateen in DelhiFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.Copyright 2025 BBC.

How the Air India crash investigation is unfolding ,"Less than 40 seconds.That's how long Air India Flight 171 was airborne before it plunged into a densely populated neighbourhood in Ahmedabad in one of India's most baffling aviation disasters in recent memory.Investigators now face the grim task of sifting through the wreckage and decoding the cockpit voice and flight data recorders of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to piece together what went catastrophically wrong in the seconds after take-off.

""If the flight data recorder shows the engines were making full power, then the attention will move to the flaps and slats. If they are found to be extended as needed, then it becomes a very difficult investigation,"" says Mr Goelz. Flaps and slats increase lift at lower speeds, helping an aircraft take off and land safely by allowing it to fly slower without stalling.""If [the trail leads] to a problem in the flight management control system, that would raise serious concerns - not just for Boeing, but for the entire aviation industry.""The Boeing 787's flight management control system is a highly automated suite that manages navigation, performance and guidance. It integrates data from a number of sensors to optimise the aircraft's flight path and fuel efficiency.With over 1,100 Boeing 787s flying worldwide since 2011, investigators must determine whether this was a systemic issue that could affect the global fleet - or a one-off failure unique to this flight, experts say. ""If it points to a system problem, then the regulatory bodies have to make some tough decisions very quickly,"" says Mr Goelz.So far, there is no indication of fault on anyone's part. India's civil aviation ministry said on Tuesday that a recent inspection of Air India's Boeing 787 fleet - 24 of 33 aircraft have been checked so far - ""did not reveal any major safety concern,"" adding that the planes and maintenance systems complied with existing standards.Boeing President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said on 12 June:  ""Boeing will defer to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) for information on Air India Flight 171, in line with UN ICAO protocol.""Decoding of the data at the AAIB lab in Delhi will be led by Indian investigators, with experts from Boeing, engine-maker GE, Air India and Indian regulators. Investigators from the NTSB and UK will also be participating.""In my experience, teams can usually determine what happened fairly quickly,"" Mr Goelz says. ""But understanding why it happened can take much longer.""The wreckage may yield other clues. ""Every part - wire, nut, bolt - will be meticulously collected,"" says Mr Chinta. Typically, wreckage is moved to a nearby hangar or secure facility, laid out to identify the nose, tail and wingtips, and then pieced together. In this case, depending on what the flight data and voice recorders reveal, a full reconstruction may not be necessary, investigators say.The importance of wreckage varies by accident, say investigators. For Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, shot down over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, it was crucial -  reconstruction of the nose revealed clear shrapnel damage from a Russia-made missile.In the wreckage, investigators will also examine fuel filters, lines, valves and residual fuel to check for contamination - something that's easy to detect or rule out, a crash investigator who preferred to remain unnamed, said. Also, he believed that the refuelling equipment used before departure ""has likely been quarantined and already inspected"".That's not all. Investigators will gather maintenance and fault history records from the airline and Boeing's ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting system) which transmits data via radio or satellite to both Boeing and Air India, says Mr Chinta.They will review all flights operated by the aircraft and the crew over recent months, along with the technical log of pilot-reported faults and corrective actions taken before release of aircraft to service.Investigators will also examine pilot licences, training records, simulator performance and instructor remarks - including how pilots handled scenarios like engine failures in advanced flight simulators. ""I reckon Air India would have already provided these records to the investigation team,"" says Mr Chinta.Investigators will review the service history of all components of the aircraft that were removed and replaced, examining reported defects for any recurring issues - or signs of problems that could have affected this flight.""These investigations are extraordinarily complex. They take time, but there will be early indicators of what likely went wrong,"" says Mr Goelz.A big reason is how far technology has come. ""One of the first accidents I investigated in 1994 had a flight data recorder tracking just four parameters,"" he says.""Today's recorders capture hundreds - if not thousands - every second. That alone has transformed the way we investigate crashes.""Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Bali flights cancelled after Indonesia volcano erupts,"Dozens of flights to and from the Indonesian resort island of Bali have been cancelled or delayed after one of country's most active volcanoes erupted.Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki on the island of Flores spewed an ash tower more than 11km (6.8 miles) into the sky at 17:35 local time (10:35 BST) on Tuesday, the country's volcanology agency said.There have not been any reports of casualties. Authorities have raised the highest alert level and advised residents to avoid activities within a 7km radius around the crater.Air India, Air New Zealand, Jetstar, Juneyao Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Australia were among those that have cancelled flights to and from Bali, located west of Flores.Flight data from Bali's I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport late on Wednesday showed that over 37 flights have been cancelled due to the volcano.Several domestic AirAsia flights leaving for Flores have also been cancelled. The twin-peaked volcano erupted multiple times in November, killing nine people and forcing thousands to flee. Geology agency head Muhammad Wafid warned of potential lahar floods - a type of mud or debris flow of volcanic materials - if heavy rain occurs.Residents were also urged to wear face masks to protect themselves from volcanic ash.The National Disaster Mitigation Agency said that at least one village had been evacuated, and ash rain was reported in several others outside the exclusion zone.A spokesman called on residents around the volcano ""to evacuate to safe locations"" as tremors were still being detected, which indicated ongoing volcanic activity.Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where tectonic plates collide, causing frequent volcanic activity as well as earthquakes.Lewotobi Laki-laki's last eruption was in May, when authorities also raised the level to the most severe.Laki-Laki, which means ""man"" in Indonesian, is twinned with the calmer but taller 1,703m named Perempuan, the Indonesian word for ""woman"".Copyright 2025 BBC.

Kenyan 'miracle babies' pastor dies in road crash,"Controversial Kenyan televangelist Gilbert Deya, who claimed he created miraculous pregnancies, has died in a road crash.Police told local media that Deya died on the spot on Tuesday evening after his vehicle was involved in an accident with a university bus and another vehicle near the town of Kisumu in western Kenya.At least 30 other people were reportedly injured, including a person identified as his wife and a passenger in his vehicle, and 15 students in the bus.Deya, who ran a church in London, rose to infamy in the early 2000s, following his claim that he could help infertile couples conceive ""miracle"" babies through prayer.Investigations later linked his church to an alleged child-trafficking ring, leading to his arrest and extradition from the UK eight years ago after a decade-long legal battle. He was acquitted of the charges in 2023 due to insufficient evidence.On Wednesday, Siaya County Governor James Orengo said he had learnt with ""deep sorrow and regret of the passing on of Bishop Gilbert Deya"".He confirmed that the ""horrific"" road accident had involved a vehicle belonging to the county.Photos shared online showed the mangled wreckage of one of the vehicles, which was completely shattered in the accident.A former stonemason-turned evangelist, Deya moved from Kenya to London in the mid-1990s, where he founded Gilbert Deya Ministries, a registered charity with branches across the UK and Africa.He was known for his charismatic preaching style and claimed to have been consecrated as an archbishop by a US evangelist in 1992.His ministries later faced multiple investigations by the UK authorities for alleged mismanagement and legal violations, including selling olive oil which were falsely claiming to have healing properties.He was once described by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, then an MP, as a ""modern-day snake-oil salesman who has conned and betrayed his vulnerable congregation"".At his church, desperate women, some past their menopause and others who were unable to conceive, would be convinced that they would become pregnant through prayer.But the babies were always ""delivered"" in backstreet clinics in Kenya's capital, Nairobi. The prosecution said the babies were stolen from poor Kenyan families.In 2011, his then wife Mary Deya was jailed after being found guilty of stealing a baby from the main referral hospital in Nairobi and falsely stating she had given birth to the baby.Deya would later tell a court that they had divorced after she had been charged, saying she had ""tarnished"" his name. Recent videos from the YouTube page of Gilbert Deya Ministries appear to show him announcing that he has a new wife, Diana Deya. When the televangelist was asked in a BBC investigation in 2014 how the alleged ""miracle"" children had different DNA to that of their alleged parents, he said it was ""beyond human imagination"".""It is not something I can say. I can explain because they are of God and things of God cannot be explained by a human being,"" he said.After his acquittal in 2023, Deya continued with his religious outreach programmes until his death, reportedly at 72.Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaCopyright 2025 BBC.

"Israeli forces kill 51 Palestinians waiting for flour at Gaza aid site, witnesses and rescuers say","Israeli forces have killed more than 51 Palestinians and wounded many more after opening fire near an aid distribution site in southern Gaza, witnesses and rescuers say.The Hamas-run civil defence agency said Israeli troops fired on crowds near the aid site in Khan Younis. More than 200 people were reportedly injured. The Israeli military has told the BBC it is looking into the reports.It is the latest, and potentially the deadliest, of the almost daily shootings that have been taking place recently near aid distribution sites in Gaza.  Almost all the casualties in Gaza in recent days have been linked to the delivery of aid rather than Israeli strikes on Hamas targets.Witnesses say that Israeli forces opened fire and shelled an area near a junction to the east of Khan Younis, where thousands of Palestinians had been gathering in the hope of getting flour from a World Food Programme (WFP) site, which also includes a community kitchen nearby.A local journalist and eyewitnesses said Israeli drones fired two missiles, followed shortly after by a shell from an Israeli tank positioned between 400 and 500m away from the crowd. The explosions caused many casualties.The crowd had assembled near a key road leading to the town of Bani Suheila, an area that has seen weeks of ongoing Israeli military operations.Nasser Hospital, the main functioning medical facility in the area, has been overwhelmed by the number of casualties. It is so overcrowded that the many wounded are lying on the floor as medical staff treat their injuries. Video showing the immediate aftermath of the incident and shared on social media has been located by BBC Verify to a location in Khan Younis. Gaza's civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that at least 50 people were killed. ""Israeli drones fired at the citizens. Some minutes later, Israeli tanks fired several shells at the citizens, which led to a large number of martyrs and wounded,"" he said.In a statement the IDF said ""a gathering was identified adjacent to an aid distribution truck that got stuck in the area of Khan Younis, and in proximity to IDF troops operating in the area.""It said it was ""aware of reports regarding a number of injured individuals from IDF fire following the crowd's approach"" and the incident was under review.The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had received reports of a mass casualty incident.""This is again the result of another food distribution initiative,"" said Thanos Gargavanis, WHO trauma surgeon and emergency officer.""There's a constant correlation with the positions of the four announced food distribution sites and the mass casualty incidents,"" he added, saying the trauma injuries in recent days were mostly from gunshot wounds.For weeks, medical staff have warned that Nasser Hospital could be overwhelmed and unable to continue to operate under the pressure of multiple casualties, lack of medical supplies and Israeli evacuation orders in the surrounding area.In recent days, the hospital has been dealing with an almost daily influx of casualties from shooting incidents near the aid distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) - backed by Israel and the US - in southern and central Gaza.In almost all those incidents, witnesses have said that Israeli troops opened fire, although there have also been reports of local armed gunmen shooting at people.The response from the IDF has usually been to say that its troops warned people not to approach them - and then fired warning shots when what the IDF calls ""suspects"" acted in a manner deemed to pose a threat. The Israeli army has provided little or no detail beyond this.Israel does not allow international news organisations including the BBC into Gaza, making verifying what is happening there difficult.The GHF has also responded to the shootings by saying that they should not be mentioned in connection to their operations, as the incidents are happening away from their sites.But there is no doubt that thousands of Palestinians would not be gathered in desperate search for limited supplies of food in those areas if it were not for the way that the new distribution system has been set up.The IDF has also told Palestinians not to head to aid distribution sites between 18:00 and 06:00 local time. But in order to reach the sites and have a chance of getting food, people have little option.Verified video from GHF sites show huge crowds of Palestinians rushing to try to get food parcels with no apparent control from the organisation. It has already closed its sites briefly on at least two occasions to try to improve security.The other way of getting aid into Gaza - with around 100 trucks a day allowed in by Israel - has also also increasingly seen people being shot as they try to get to the supplies, whether from distribution points or from the aid convoy itself as it travels towards them.It's a sign of a breakdown both in security in Gaza and in the aid distribution system itself.Hamas has responded to the latest incident by again describing the aid centres as death traps.Looting among a population desperate for scarce supplies of food - with criminal gangs, militias and Hamas also operating for their own ends - has rendered the situation even more perilous.Critics see the GHF as enabling a plan by the Israeli government to displace Palestinians south into smaller areas of Gaza. But Israel - which has long sought to remove the UN as the major humanitarian provider to Palestinians - argues the alternative system was needed to stop Hamas stealing aid.On Monday, the UN human rights chief Volker Turk said that Israel was weaponising food and called for a full investigation into the shootings.The head of Unrwa - the UN agency for Palestinian refugees - Philippe Lazzarini has said that in Gaza  'tragedies go on unabated while attention shifts elsewhere'.Yet there seems to be no plan from Israel, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or the international community to find a way to prevent the near daily killing of Palestinians, as they take their lives in their hands to seek a meagre supply of food.  It has been 20 months since Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led cross-border attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 55,297 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Death toll rises after Russia's deadliest attack on Kyiv for months,"Ukrainian emergency services have continued to recover bodies from under rubble in Kyiv after Russia hit the city with a huge missile and drone attack overnight into Tuesday.At least 28 people have been killed and more than 100 injured, officials said, as the death toll increased on Wednesday after having been revised several times, both upwards and downwards. There were also two fatalities in Odesa.As part of the strikes, a drone smashed into an apartment block destroying dozens of flats.The attack was among the biggest on the capital since the start of Russia's full-scale war, with Ukraine's interior minister saying the country had been hit by 440 drones and 32 missiles.Russia's defence ministry said it had targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complexes and that all its targets had been hit.The strikes on Kyiv lasted more than nine hours – sending residents fleeing to underground shelters from before midnight until after sunrise.Officials said a ballistic missile hit a nine-storey apartment building in the southwestern Solomyanskyi district - bodies continued to be recovered from the site on Wednesday.A total of 27 locations in the city came under fire, according to authorities.A 62-year-old US citizen was among those killed in Solomyanskyi, Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said early on Tuesday.US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce later confirmed the ""tragic death"" of an American citizen.Standing in front of the remains of the building, Klitschko said more than 40 apartments had been destroyed and more people might be trapped under the rubble.He accused Russia of firing cluster bomblets filled with ball bearings to kill as many people as possible.""Waking up in utter nightmare: people trapped under rubble and full buildings collapsed,"" Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko wrote on X on Tuesday.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said that a variety of buildings had come under Russian attack, including residential, critical infrastructure and educational facilities.People were still under the rubble by late afternoon on Tuesday and rescue work was going on at two sites, he said. Klymenko explained that initial mistakes made in counting the dead often happened because body parts were wrongly identified.Loud explosions rocked the city in the early hours of Tuesday, along with the rattle of the machine guns used by mobile Ukrainian air defence units to shoot down drones.More sirens later in the morning disrupted rescue operations in the city, hampering emergency workers searching the rubble for survivors.Russia has intensified its air attacks against Ukrainian cities in recent weeks, with a tactic of sending large waves of drones and decoys designed to overwhelm Ukrainian air defences.Kyiv has launched attacks of its own, as direct talks between the warring sides failed to secure a ceasefire or significant breakthrough. Russia accused Ukrainian forces of launching a missile strike on a district in occupied Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, and Russia-appointed officials said at least 10 people had been hurt.A reported 147 Ukrainian drones were shot down over nine Russian regions overnight, Russian news agencies said.President Zelensky called Russia's most recent wave of strikes ""pure terrorism"".He accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of carrying out the large-scale strikes ""solely because he can afford to continue this war"".""It is bad when the powerful of this world turn a blind eye to this,"" he said, adding: ""It is the terrorists who should feel the pain, not normal, peaceful people.""Drone strikes also hit the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, killing two people and wounding 10 others, officials said.Zelensky had been hoping to speak with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit on Tuesday, but Trump cut short his stay amid the escalating crisis in the Middle East.The news would have come as a blow to Zelensky and his administration, which had been hoping to secure US support at the conference for Ukraine's strategic and military goals.Copyright 2025 BBC.

"Trump to extend US TikTok ban deadline, White House says","TikTok will live on for at least another three months in the United States, as President Donald Trump is poised to extend a sale or ban deadline for the third time since taking office this year.""President Trump will sign an additional Executive Order this week to keep TikTok up and running,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday.The popular video sharing app was supposed to be banned in the US after its Chinese owner, ByteDance, refused to sell it to a US buyer by a January deadline.TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the BBC.Leavitt said the 90-day extension would ""ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.""Before Leavitt's announcement, Trump told the BBC that he would ""probably"" extend the TikTok deadline.""We'll probably have to get China approval,"" Trump said. ""I think we'll get it. I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.""When asked if he has the legal basis to extend the deadline, he responded: ""We do.""Trump's extension is at odds with the will of Congress, which passed the sale-or-ban measure last year. His predecessor, former President Joe Biden, immediately signed the bill into law.The law was aimed to address concerns that TikTok, which has 170 million American users, could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.The Supreme Court agreed with a lower court and upheld the law in January just before Trump was set to take office.The platform briefly went dark for a few hours during the weekend before Trump's inauguration.TikTok praised Trump for saving the platform after it became available again.Trump tried to force a sale of TikTok to an American buyer in 2020, during his first term in office.But last year, Trump said he liked the platform because he believed it had helped him win the 2024 presidential election.""I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,"" Trump said in December, although most young voters backed the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.Trump's unilateral deadline extensions have led some analysts to dismiss the notion that a ban might ever take place during his time in office.""What ban? There is nothing 'looming' about the potential TikTok ban anymore,"" said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering. ""TikTok's behaviour also indicates they're confident in their future, as they rolled out new AI video tools at Cannes this week.""""Smaller players, like Snap, will try to steal share during this ""uncertain time,"" but they will not succeed because this next round for TikTok isn't uncertain at all,"" Ms Chickering added.The Trump administration said in April that the US and China had neared a deal that would have placed majority control of TikTok's US operations under American ownership. That deal has yet to materialise.""There are key matters to be resolved,"" a ByteDance spokesperson said at the time. ""Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.""Trump has said he would be open to seeing it sold to cloud computing giant Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison is a long-time ally of Trump's.Billionaire Frank McCourt, Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian are part of another team bidding for the platform.And the biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has said he's also interested in buying TikTok as part of a different investor group.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Russia fears another loss in Middle East from Iran's conflict with Israel,"When Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, officials in Russia described the current escalation in the Middle East as ""alarming"" and ""dangerous.""Still, Russian media were quick to stress the potential positives for Moscow.Among them:However, the longer Israel's military operation goes on, the greater the realisation that Russia has much to lose from current events.""The escalation of the conflict carries serious risks and potential costs for Moscow,"" wrote Russian political scientist Andrei Kortunov in business daily Kommersant on Monday.""The fact remains that Russia was unable to prevent a mass strike by Israel on a country with which five months ago [Russia] signed a comprehensive strategic partnership. ""Clearly Moscow is not prepared to go beyond political statements condemning Israel, it's not ready to provide Iran with military assistance.""The Russian-Iranian strategic partnership deal which Vladimir Putin and President Masoud Pezeshkian signed earlier this year is not a military alliance. It does not oblige Moscow to come to Tehran's defence.At the time, though, Moscow talked it up.In an interview with the Ria Novosti news agency, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov noted that the agreement paid ""special attention to the strengthening of co-ordination in the interests of peace and security on the regional and global levels, and the desire of Moscow and Tehran for closer co-operation on security and defence"".In the last six months Moscow has already lost one key ally in the Middle East, Bashar al-Assad.After the Syrian leader was deposed last December he was offered asylum in Russia. The prospect of regime change in Iran, the thought of losing another strategic partner in the region, will be of major concern to Moscow.Commenting on developments in the Middle East on Tuesday, Moskovsky Komsomolets concluded: ""In global politics right now, massive changes are taking place in real time which will affect life in our country, either directly or indirectly.""Vladimir Putin will be spending much of this week in St Petersburg where the city is hosting its annual International Economic Forum. The event was once dubbed ""Russia's Davos"", but the label doesn't really apply now. In recent years the chief executives of big Western companies have stayed away – especially since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Nonetheless, the organisers claim that this year representatives from more than 140 countries and territories will attend. Russian authorities will almost certainly use the event to try to demonstrate that attempts to isolate Russia over the war in Ukraine have failed.An economic forum it may be, but geopolitics is never far away. We'll be watching closely for any comments the Kremlin leader makes about the Middle East and about Ukraine.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Tennis icon Navratilova defected to the US 50 years ago. Would she do the same today?,"Fifty years ago, Martina Navratilova left everything she knew in communist Czechoslovakia to start a new life in the US.Then an 18-year-old high school pupil, she was one of the Cold War's most high-profile defectors - and she would go on to become one of tennis's most iconic players.But speaking to the BBC's Amol Rajan, she says that she fears the US now ""wouldn't let me in"".""I'm not loyal to [US President] Donald Trump,"" she says, adding that she worries the US has become a ""totalitarian"" state.Since President Trump took office in January, his administration has carried out sweeping immigration raids, sparking protests in parts of the country. He has also instituted a travel ban for citizens from 12 countries, and there have been reports of tourists being detained at the border.""If I were now still in that same position [as in 1975] and I had to go live somewhere, it would not be America, because it's not a democracy at the moment,"" she says.When she speaks about US politics, Navratilova's frustration is palpable. She believes people haven't noticed what she says is a situation that is gradually getting worse.The US, she adds, is ""definitely turning against migrants"".""I mean, people are getting chucked out by Homeland Security, they're getting chucked out because they're not on board completely with Donald Trump's agenda… because they're not kissing the ring,"" she says.That decision to defect to the US in 1975 wasn't an easy one to make, she says. She describes having an ""idyllic"" childhood growing up in Revnice, in modern-day Czechia, with a loving family that she was leaving behind. ""I never knew when I would see my parents again - or if I would see them.""But doing so changed the course of Navratilova's life. She told a press conference at the time that she left Czechoslovakia because she wanted to become world number one in tennis - and that she ""couldn't do it under those circumstances at home"".She did indeed go on to become number one - both in women's singles for 332 weeks, and women's doubles for a record 237 weeks. She is now widely considered to be one of the world's greatest tennis players.Navratilova is a dual US and Czech citizen, and still lives in the US with her wife, model Julia Lemigova. Does she worry that, in the current political climate, she could lose her own citizenship?""Everything is up in the air right now, and that's the whole point. Everybody's walking on eggshells, not knowing what's going to happen.""There is, however, one extremely divisive subject on which she has previously said she agrees with President Trump - transgender women's participation in sport.Navratilova is firm in her belief that the inclusion of trans women in women's tennis is ""wrong"".She says she doesn't agree with current World Tennis Association (WTA) rules, which state transgender women can participate in women's games if they provide a written and signed declaration that they are female or non-binary, that their testosterone levels have been below a certain limit for two years, and that they sustain those levels of testosterone.She says she feels trans women have biological advantages in women's sports - a belief that is hotly debated.""There should be no ostracism, there should be no bullying,"" she says, ""but male bodies need to play in male sports. They can still compete. There is no ban on transwomen in sports. They just need to compete in the proper category which is the male category. It's that simple."" She adds: ""By including male bodies in the women's tournament, now somebody is not getting into the tournament - a woman is not getting into the tournament because now a male has taken her place.""In December last year, Britain's Lawn Tennis Association changed its rules, meaning transgender women can no longer play in some female domestic tennis tournaments.And in April, the UK's Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex. Asked if she felt tennis should follow the lead of the UK court, she says: ""100%""Pushed on whether we should ""spend a bit more time being sympathetic to"" trans people, Navratilova replies: ""Very sympathetic - but that still doesn't give them a right to women's sex-based spaces.""Navratilova has been open about her battles with cancer over the last 15 years.She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, at the age of 52. Then, 13 years later, it returned - along with a second, completely unrelated cancer in her throat.""The way I found out, I went like this"", Navratilova says, smacking her hands on the sides of her face as if shocked by something. ""And I'm like, 'oh, this lymph node is a little bit bigger'. And a couple of weeks later, it's still bigger.""Following a scan, doctors also caught the second cancer in her breast.""We got the results, and it's cancer,"" she says. ""And I'm like, 'Oh my God, I'm going to die'.""Although she says the treatment was ""hell"", she feels ""all good"" now.""Knock on wood, all clear, and no side effects at all - other than red wine still doesn't taste good, so I've gone sideways towards tequila and vodka,"" she laughs. ""I'm lucky. The cure was hell, but the aftermath has been great.""Has having cancer changed Navratilova at all?""Cancer taught me to really appreciate every day, which I was doing pretty much anyway,"" she says. ""But most of all, to not sweat the small stuff. It's fixable.""Amol Rajan Interviews: Martina Navratilova is on BBC 2 at 19:00 on 18 June, and on BBC iPlayer.Copyright 2025 BBC.

The teen who filmed the Air India crash video the world saw,"Every time Aryan Asari heard the sound of an aeroplane, he would go darting out of the house to look for it.Spotting planes was something of a hobby for him, his father Maganbhai Asari said. Aryan loved the roaring sound of the engine fill the air and then grow louder as the plane cruised above him, leaving behind chalky threads of contrail in the sky.But now, the very thought of it makes him sick.Last Thursday, the 17-year-old had been on the terrace of Mr Asari's house in Ahmedabad city, making videos of aeroplanes, when an Air India Dreamliner 787-8 crashed right before his eyes and burst into flames, killing 241 on board. Nearly 30 people were also killed on the ground.The moment was captured by Aryan on his phone.""I saw the plane. It was going down and down. Then it wobbled and crashed right before my eyes,"" he told BBC Gujarati in an interview earlier this week.The video, now a crucial clue for investigators trying to find the cause of the crash, has sent ripples through the news media and put Aryan - a high school student - at the centre of one of the worst aviation disasters in the country's history.""We have been swamped by interview requests. Reporters have been milling around my house day and night asking to speak to him,"" Mr Asari told the BBC.The incident - and what has followed since - has had a ""devastating impact"" on Aryan, who is traumatised by what he saw. ""My son is so scared that he has stopped using his phone,"" Mr Asari said. A retired army soldier, who now works with the city's metro service, Mr Asari has been staying for three years in a neighbourhood close to the airport. He recently moved to a small room located on the terrace of a three-storey building, with a clear view of the city skyline.His wife and two children - Aryan and his elder sister - live in their ancestral village near the border between Gujarat and Rajasthan states.""This was Aryan's first time in Ahmedabad. Actually, it was the first time in his life that he left the village,"" Mr Asari said.""Whenever I'd call, Aryan would ask if I could spot aeroplanes from our terrace and I would tell him you could see hundreds of them streaking the sky.""Aryan, he explained, was an aeroplane enthusiast and liked looking at them as they flew in the sky over his village. The idea that he could see them much more closely from the terrace of his father's new home was very appealing to him.An opportunity presented itself last week when Mr Asari's daughter, who wants to become a police officer, travelled to Ahmedabad to write the entrance examination.Aryan decided to accompany her. ""He told me he wanted to buy new notebooks and clothes,"" Mr Asari said.The siblings arrived at their father's house around noon on Thursday, roughly an hour-and-a-half before the crash. The family ate lunch together, after which Mr Asari left for work, leaving the children at home.Aryan stepped out on the terrace and started making videos of the house to show to his friends. That's when he spotted the Air India plane and began filming it, he told BBC Gujarati.Aryan soon realised that something was not quite right about the aircraft: ""It was shaking, moving left and right,"" he said.As the plane went on a downward spiral, he kept filming it, unable to grasp what was about to happen.But when  thick smoke filled the air and fire spewed out of the buildings, he finally realised what he had just witnessed. He sent the video to his father and called him up.""He sounded so frightened - 'I saw it papa, I saw it crash,' he said to me and kept asking me what would happen to him. I told him to sit tight and not to worry,"" Mr Asari said. ""But he was beside himself in horror.""Mr Asari also asked his son to not share the video further. However, too scared and shocked, Aryan sent it to a few of his friends. ""The next thing we knew, the clip was everywhere.""The next few days were a nightmare for the family.Neighbours, reporters and camera persons flooded Mr Asari's small house day and night, requesting to speak to Aryan. ""We could do nothing to stop them,"" he said.The family also received a visit from the police, who took Aryan to the station and recorded his statement.Mr Asari clarified, that contrary to reports, Aryan was not detained, but that police questioned him for a few hours about what he saw.""My son was so disturbed by then that we decided to send him back to the village.""Back at home, Aryan has resumed school but is ""still not feeling like himself. His mother tells me that every time his phone rings, he gets scared"", Mr Asari said.""I know he will be fine with time. But I don't think my son will try looking for airplanes in the sky again,"" he added.Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar, BBC Gujarati, in Ahmedabad.

Why the death of a blogger has put Kenya's police on trial,"""My son died like an animal,"" said Meshack Ojwang, before breaking down in tears in front of journalists outside Central Police Station in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.His only son Albert Ojwang had been arrested in their village of Kakoth, near the western town of Homa Bay, the day before - Saturday 7 June 2025 - as he was having lunch with his wife Nevnina Onyango.One of the five arresting officers told the family he was accused of insulting a police boss on social media.""We asked the police if he was going to be safe, because we had heard stories of some people being abducted,"" Ms Onyango told the BBC. ""They assured us, at the point of even them giving us their [phone] numbers.""When Mr Ojwang was booked into Central Police Station at around 21:30 on the Saturday night he was allowed to phone his wife.""When we talked, he was like: 'As much as I'm stressed, don't worry that much. I'll see you soon.' I think those were his last words,"" she said.But his father was concerned and decided to follow his son, making the 350km (220 miles) journey to Nairobi - carrying the family's land title deed as security in case it was needed to pay bail.He says he arrived at the station early on the Sunday morning, and after being kept waiting for several hours, was eventually told that his son had died from self-inflicted wounds.In disbelief and standing next to his lawyer, he described seeing his son's body: ""He was bleeding from the nose and had a bruised torso and face. He was also shirtless, but this is not how I handed him over to the police on Saturday.""His candid interview in heartfelt Swahili and his refusal to stay silent touched Kenyans and the hashtag #JusticeForAlbertOjwang immediately began trending, with calls for an investigation.Kenya has a history of police brutality, but the subsequent revelations have stunned the nation - not only the details about the death in police custody of the trained teacher turned blogger, but the ensuing allegations of police lies and subterfuge.Parliament even called in the chief of police, the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), the internal affairs minister and the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) for questioning.It is hard to imagine why the 31-year-old Bachelor of Education graduate could have died in such brutal circumstances.It is clear that his father, who used to work in a quarry in south-eastern Kenya, was proud that his son had done so well academically from such humble beginnings.""He could never hurt anyone either online or physically,"" David Bwakali, a former teaching colleague at Kituma Secondary School, told Kenya's Daily Nation's newspaper.Albert Ojwang, a passionate Manchester United football fan, had taught religious studies, history and rugby at the school in the south-eastern town of Mwatate.He was only there for a couple of terms last year as he had not been employed on a government contract but privately through the school's management board.This is common for new teachers - he had not long graduated from Pwani University - and such arrangements tend not to be well paid.Mr Bwakali said his friend had recently been in touch to discuss how he hoped to get a posting as a government teacher.It was an exciting time for Mr Ojwang, who lived in the coastal town of Malindi, as he and his 26-year-old wife had gone back to his rural Homa Bay home for a long visit so she could be properly introduced to his family.They had arrived in April and were, according to Luo customs, formalising their marriage.Part of these traditions involved refurbishing his ""simba"" - or bachelor's pad within his father's homestead - into a home suitable for the couple and their three-year-old son George.He was helping his parents out by doing some farm work on the family's two-acre plot of land - and he and his wife were making plans for their future with Ms Onyango's imminent graduation as a health worker.Mr Ojwang was also trying to make money as a digital content creator - and was part of a movement of young people on social media posting about political and social issues.This is what led to his death.It is not clear how many followers he had on X as his account was deleted after his arrest, but fellow influencers said he had a strong online presence and often participated in social media campaigns.He used a pseudonym - which is not unusual with Kenyans online given recent crackdowns on youth dissent.Activists have linked his death to a broader trend of police brutality and  impunity, citing the unresolved deaths of more than 60 young people during last year's anti-tax protests.""Ojwang's death is not an isolated incident but a chilling reminder of the institutionalised impunity and rogue behaviour within the National Police Service (NPS),"" Muslims for Human Rights (MUHURI) director and renowned human rights defender Khelef Khalifa told local media.But what is unusual about Albert Ojwang's case is how swiftly and detailed the investigation has been. In addition, two days of televised parliamentary hearings have meant that Kenyans have heard for themselves the disturbing details that led to his death.When appearing before the parliament last Wednesday, police chief Douglas Kanja was forced to retract an earlier police statement that said that Mr Ojwang was found unconscious in his cell and rushed to hospital, where he died of head injuries sustained after he banged his own head against a wall.The post-mortem examination and an unusually speedy investigation by the IPOA ruled out the possibility that the blogger had killed himself.The police chief apologised and blamed the error on ""misinformation"" from his juniors.He went on to say that the arrest of Mr Ojwang had stemmed from defamatory online posts targeting his deputy, Eliud Lagat - who has since stepped aside. Mr Lagat said he was doing so in the ""good and conscious thought"" of his responsibilities as deputy police chief and that he would provide any support he could to the investigation into the blogger's death.According to Mr Kanja's statement to parliament, the posts on X had alleged Mr Lagat was running corrupt operations in the police by placing trusted officers in specific departments and traffic shifts to ""control both revenue streams and intelligence flow"".Mr Kanja's statement detailed various posts including one that claimed Mr Lagat was under investigation by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) along with his photo and the phrase ""Mafia Cop"".According to the police chief's parliamentary statement, Mr Lagat had submitted a complaint to the DCI on 4 June about the posts. The next day when the EACC confirmed there was no investigation into Mr Lagat, the police proceeded with what was regarded as a ""serious case"" under the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act.Mr Kanja said the Communications Authority was contacted about two accounts linked to the posts. This led to the arrest of a man on 5 June who revealed that he and four others were involved in the campaign - one being Albert Ojwang.Two days later, the police had tracked Mr Ojwang down to his home village in western Kenya.In her testimony, IPOA Vice-Chair Anne Wanjiku gave some shocking details about the last few hours of Mr Ojwang's life.She said two witnesses, who were in a neighbouring cell, told the IPOA that they had heard loud screams on the night he died.IPOA investigators claim that a technician was paid $30 (£22) to disconnect the CCTV in the station.After the parliamentary hearings ended, two police officers were arrested in connection with Mr Ojwang's death.The IPOA, which is bringing the case, said junior officer PC James Mukhwana had told investigators the intention had been to ""discipline"" Mr Ojwang, not kill him.He said the officer in charge of the station, Samson Talam, had been contacted by Mr Lagat with the order and had given the constable $15 to pay two inmates to beat up Mr Ojwang.Mr Talam, through his lawyers, has denied the allegation and Mr Lagat has not commented.Under Kenyan law, individuals in police custody are entitled to specific protections, including the right to legal representation and communication with advocates or support persons.Mr Ojwang's family are still having difficulty absorbing their loss.""I had not believed it until I saw his body in the morgue,"" said Ms Onyango, telling the BBC it bore signs of torture. It was like ""things that we just see in movies… I've never seen such a body. It was so heart-breaking,"" she said.President William Ruto, who pledged to end Kenya's history of police brutality and extrajudicial deaths when he came into power in 2022, has spoken about his shock, saying: ""This tragic occurrence, at the hands of police, is heart-breaking and unacceptable.""He urged the police to co-operate fully to facilitate a ""swift, transparent and credible investigation"".""I fully expect that the truth about what happened to Ojwang will be established in due course and that justice will be served,"" he added.However nearly 160 cases of suspected extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances were reported across Kenya last year, according to the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC).IPOA chairperson Ahmed Issack Hassan told MPs when he was questioned on Thursday that at least 20 people had died while held by police in the past four months alone.""It is as if our constitution only is there like a newspaper to be read, and tomorrow we forget about it,"" Mr Ojwang's father told the BBC.Grief has overwhelmed Mr Ojwang's widow: ""I don't know what will happen next, because that one person that was my best friend… he's not there. So, I feel like my world is so small and it's dark.""But like her father-in-law, Ms Onyango believes the case, which has sparked protests, could be a turning point.""I think Albert's death should be an eye-opening to us, because it has shown us some of the things that are happening in the cells that maybe we don't know.""I really want to talk to my fellow Kenyans to stand on our feet and try and talk about this matter, so that everybody can be accountable.""Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaCopyright 2025 BBC.

The vicious tone of national politics pollutes Minnesota after shooting,"Jessie Ebertz held back tears as she stood in front of a makeshift memorial honouring Democratic politician Melissa Hortman and her husband who were killed last week.""Minnesota has felt a little bit like a safe haven,"" said Ms Ebertz, a government employee who lives in the state capital, ""because we have been able to keep our atmosphere of respecting one another here.""""This has blown that out of the water.""The death of Hortman and her husband, Mark, has sent a shockwave through the state. They were shot dead early on Saturday morning by a man disguised as a police officer.Democratic state lawmaker John Hoffman and his wife were also injured - they are expected to survive. But the attacks, which appear politically motivated, have badly shaken confidence in the state's reputation for politeness, courtesy and respect, an attitude that has its own nickname and Wikipedia page: ""Minnesota nice"". Prosecutors say the suspect Vance Boelter also visited two other homes early Saturday searching for politicians.The state's largest-ever manhunt ended late Sunday when Boelter was captured near his home in a rural area dotted with farms, gravel roads and small villages about an hour away from the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.Many pointed out that Mrs Hortman was known for her ability to work with Republican colleagues, including recently to pass a state budget vote. On Monday local talk radio station WCCO replayed one of her last interviews, jointly done with Republican colleagues, where among other things they discussed what they might do if they spent some off time together.The idea that this friendly state in the Upper Midwest could avoid the political rancour which is more frequently tipping over into violence elsewhere is an illusion, says Jenna Stocker, editor of Thinking Minnesota, a publication put out by the conservative think tank Center of the American Experiment.The centre's office was firebombed last year in what think tank officials called a politically motivated attack. Nobody has been charged with the crime.""Some people even here in Minnesota have really let politics guide their thinking and how they feel about their neighbours, their friends and their relatives,"" Ms Stocker says.In extreme cases, that has led to extreme actions. Several recent studies indicate that political violence is growing across the US, reaching a level not seen since the 1970s.Reuters has tallied more than 300 cases of politically motivated violence since the January 2021 Capitol riot. A 2023 study from the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning institute, found that 40% of state legislators had experienced threats or attacks in the three years prior.Despite widespread fears, fuelled in part by two assassination attempts against Donald Trump and the 2021 US Capitol riot, there was no large-scale violence around the time of the November 2024 presidential election.But relations have become strained since that vote.In April the residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was set on fire. Politics appear to have motivated the alleged killers of a health-care executive in New York and two Israeli embassy employees in Washington.In Washington, members of the US Congress were set to get emergency briefings about security this week.Here in Minnesota, meanwhile, many people were lamenting what the attacks on the state's politicians mean in a place that prides itself on its openness and ability to avoid the viciousness of national politics.Despite the rawness of the recent attacks, inside the Capitol building there was little visible sign of heavy security – and no metal detectors – on Monday afternoon. Among the mourners, several of Hortman's relatives laid flowers in front of the state House chamber, where a table was laden with bouquets and signs reading ""Demand Change"" and ""Rest in Power"".In between the news cameras and flowers, a group wandered around the building on a guided tour and legislative officials went about their work in an eerie hush.But as people here mourned, nationally the partisan arguments continued.President Trump on Tuesday said he wouldn't phone Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in last year's election, calling him ""a mess"".""The guy doesn't have a clue,"" he told reporters.In the wake of the attacks, several of Trump's top supporters and allies - including Utah Senator Mike Lee, Elon Musk, conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer and activist Charlie Kirk - attempted without evidence to link Walz and Democratic lawmakers to the killings.Lee wrote: ""This is what happens When Marxists don't get their way"" while Musk reposted a message including a line about the attacks with the comment ""The far left is murderously violent"".Both men, who did not respond to requests for comment, appear to have been sucked in by conspiracy theories floating around online.Many pointed to the fact that Walz and a previous Democratic governor had appointed the suspect to a position on a state economic board.However, Boelter was a supporter of President Trump who held conservative views, according to interviews with friends and neighbours. According to evidence revealed by authorities, his long target list included Democratic and progressive lawmakers, and he had flyers with information about anti-Trump ""No Kings"" rallies which happened in St Paul and other cities around the country on Saturday.Although the exact motive is still under investigation, evidence has indicated that the suspect was targeting the president's opponents and left-wing and Democratic Party politicians.""It's terrifying,"" said Kameko White, a neighbour who lived near one of the suspect's homes, in north Minneapolis, which was raided by police on Saturday.""I saw that man every day in his yard,"" Ms White said. ""The other day I saw him outside smoking and writing something down in a notebook.""While the capture of Mr Boelter gave some measure of relief here, discussions on the airwaves in Minnesota have turned towards what can be done to cool the political temperature and prevent future attacks.Ms Stocker, the editor of Thinking Minnesota, said ""there's good people here"" and noted that the vast majority of Minnesotans reject violence.However an increase in ""othering"" and heated rhetoric makes her pessimistic about the chances of peace any time soon.""It's going to take a whole generation of people to say we're not going to take this any more and it just needs to stop,"" she said.""I think we need young people to rise up and say we're just not going to stand for it.""Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

US Supreme Court upholds Tennessee ban on gender transition care for minors,"The US Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law banning gender transition care for young people, in a decision expected to have consequences nationwide, given that 25 states have similar laws.The justices voted 6 to 3 that the 2023 law restricting minors' access to treatments such as puberty blockers was not discrimination. Three Tennessee transgender teenagers, their parents, and a doctor who provides transition medications had argued the state's ban violated a US constitutional guarantee of equal protection under the law by discriminating on the basis of sex.The case, known as United States v Skrmetti, was the first time the court had taken up transgender healthcare.The decision was written by Chief Justice John Roberts, who said that the law, known as SB1, does not discriminate against transgender people. He also wrote that: ""Tennessee concluded that there is an ongoing debate among medical experts regarding the risks and benefits associated with administering puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, and gender incongruence."" ""SB1's ban on such treatments responds directly to that uncertainty,"" he concluded.The Tennessee law bans any procedure that enables ""a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex"" or that treats ""purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity"".Treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapies are used for a range of medical conditions. The Tennessee families who sued said their children are being unfairly targeted because the law still allows minors with other medical needs to receive the medications.They also argued the ban violated a parent's right to access necessary care for their children.The three liberal justices - Sonia Sotomayor,  Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented from the ruling.Sotomayor, who wrote the dissent and also read it from the bench to emphasise her strong disagreement, wrote that the ban does lead to ""medical discrimination on the basis of sex"" and that in its ruling ""the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims"".""[The Court] authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them,"" Sotomayor wrote. Former President Joe Biden's administration had joined the case in support of the families.  President Donald Trump's administration then notified the court this year that it did not stand by the previous government's arguments, but  it would still allow to case to continue so the court could weigh in.Tennessee's Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti on social media called the decision a ""landmark victory"". ""This is a big win for evidence-based medicine, this is a big win for democracy, for letting state governments decide what state laws should be,"" he said. Skrmetti and Tennessee have argued this type of ban is necessary because of the ""irreversible"" nature of gender-transition treatments. But transgender advocates have disagreed, saying drugs like puberty blockers are fully reversible and banning access to that care poses more risks. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation's leading LGBTQ civil rights group, described the decision as ""devastating"".""This Court chose to allow politicians to interfere in medical decisions that should be made by doctors, patients, and families - a cruel betrayal of the children who needed them to stand up for justice when it mattered most,"" HRC president Kelley Robinson said in a statement.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Czech fake dentist gave root canals after reading online instructions,"A 22-year-old fake dentist and two assistants have been charged by Czech police after treating dozens of patients using instructions found on the internet. Police said the three family members opened a surgery without a licence in their home in Havlickuv Brod two years ago and treated patients without any ""necessary professional knowledge"".They added that the 22-year-old man extracted teeth, performed complex root canals and applied anaesthesia, drawing on information he had obtained online.All pleaded guilty to a number of charges, police said, and face up to eight years in prison. Police did not say whether any of their patients had complained about their treatment.A 50-year-old woman worked as a nurse, while a 44-year-old man produced prosthetic devices for patients.The illegal clinic treated dozens of patients and made four million Czech koruna (£137,827, $185,500), police said.""The woman, who worked in the health sector, provided anaesthetics but also other dental material to which she had access, such as fillings, cleaning powder, glue, impression material and much more,"" police said in a statement.""A 22-year-old man posed as a dentist, although he lacked the necessary professional knowledge.""Police spokeswoman Michaela Lebrova declined to comment on whether the force was acting on complaints from patients.All three were arrested earlier this month, before being charged this week with operating an illegal business, money laundering, attempted assault, drug dealing and theft. All have pleaded guilty, police said.The president of Czech dental chamber, Roman Šmucler, said that he had an average of 10 fake dentist cases reported a year in the country.""I have two more submissions today, so today there are three cases in the Czech Republic,"" Šmucler told Czech media outlet Radiožurnál.The Czech parliament last year passed a bill facilitating the employment of dentists from countries outside the EU.Copyright 2025 BBC.

Japan's Nippon seals controversial US Steel deal after Trump pact,"Japanese firm Nippon Steel has completed its long-sought takeover of US Steel, after agreeing to yield unusual control to the US government. Nippon's $14.9bn (£11bn) purchase of the smaller American company, will create one of the world's biggest steelmakers and turns Nippon into a major player in the US.The plan, first announced in 2023, had  been seen as a lifeline for the storied but struggling 124-year-old US Steel.But the deal ran into trouble during last year's presidential election, when US President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponents said they were concerned about the foreign acquisition of one of the last major steel producers in the US. However, Trump reversed his stance, after Nippon made concessions which the President said had satisfied his national security concerns.He gave the official green light to the deal in an executive order on Friday.Nippon agreed to pay $55 per share and take on the company's debt, a deal worth $14.9bn together. It said it had also promised the government it would invest $11bn in US Steel by 2028, including a new facility that would be completed after that year. It also granted the US government a ""golden share"" in the company, giving the government say over key decisions, including the transfer of jobs or production outside of the US, and certain calls to close or idle factories. Nippon also committed to maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and install US citizens to key management positions including its chief executive and the majority of its board.""This partnership ensures that US Steel will retain its iconic name and headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and that it will continue to be mined, melted, and made in America for generations to come,"" Nippon and US Steel said in a statement as shares in US Steel stopped trading. They said the deal would ""protect and create more than 100,000 jobs"".Trump has made protections for the steel industry a key part of his economic agenda, raising tariffs on imports of the metal to 50% to benefit American producers.  The president said he changed his mind about deal after hearing from local officials, who were alarmed by warnings from US Steel that it might cut jobs without the investment from Nippon. Leaders of the US Steelworkers union had opposed the takeover, which former president Joe Biden blocked in his final weeks of office. The companies subsequently filed a lawsuit accusing him of improperly politicising a national security review. In a statement, the president of the US Steelworkers union said that Nippon's final agreement had granted the president a ""startling degree of personal control"" over a corporation, while predicting attention on the company would now fade. ""However, our union will remain. We will continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments,"" president David McCall said. Copyright 2025 BBC.

US moves 30 jets as Iran attack speculation grows,"At least 30 US military planes have been moved from bases in America to Europe over the past three days, flight tracking data reviewed by BBC Verify has shown.The planes in question are all US military tanker aircraft used to re-fuel fighter jets and bombers. According to Flightradar24, at least seven of these - all KC-135s - stopped off in US airbases in Spain, Scotland and England.The flights come as Israel and Iran continue to exchange strikes, after Israel launched an operation on Friday that it said was to destroy Tehran's nuclear programme.It is unclear whether the US movements are directly connected to the conflict, but one expert told BBC Verify that the tanker aircraft flights were ""highly unusual"".Justin Bronk, a senior analyst with the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said that the deployments were ""highly suggestive"" that the US was putting in place contingency plans to ""support intensive combat operations""  in the region in the coming weeks.The seven jets tracked by BBC Verify have since travelled on and according to flight tracking data could be seen flying east of Sicily as of Tuesday afternoon. Six had no stated destination - one landed on the Greek island of Crete.But the former head of Irish Defence Forces, Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, said that the movements could be part of a broader policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" that could be attempting to influence Iran to make concessions in talks over its nuclear programme.Israel initially launched an attack on Iranian nuclear infrastructure on Friday, just a day after President Donald Trump's deadline to Iran to strike a deal on suspending its nuclear programme expired.The jet movements come amid reports that the US has also moved an aircraft carrier - the USS Nimitz, from the South China Sea towards the Middle East. The Reuters news agency reported that a planned event involving the ship in Vietnam was cancelled after what the US embassy in Hanoi called an ""emergent operational requirement"".MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking website, showed that the USS Nimitz's last location was in the Malacca Strait heading towards Singapore early on Tuesday. The Nimitz carries a contingent of fighter jets and is escorted by several guided missile destroyers.The US has also moved F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter jets to bases in the Middle East, three defence officials told Reuters on Tuesday. The tanker planes moved to Europe over the past several days can be used to re-fuel these jets.Earlier on Tuesday, Vice-President JD Vance suggested that the US could intervene to support Israel's campaign, writing on social media that Trump ""may decide he needs to take further action"" to end Iran's nuclear programme.Tehran is believed to run two principal underground enrichment sites. Natanz has already been hit by Israel, and Fordo is buried deep within a mountain complex near the city of Qom.To penetrate the facility, the US would likely have to use GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) munitions, two senior Western military officers told BBC Verify. MOPs are huge, 30,000lb (13,600kg) bombs also known as ""bunker busters"".The bomb is the only conventional weapon of its kind that is thought to be capable of breaching up to 200ft (60m) of concrete. Only the B-2 stealth bomber can carry the munitions.Recently, the US has had a squadron of B-2 bombers at its base on the island of Diego Garcia. While the island is some 2,400 miles from Iran's southern coastline, their location on Diego Garcia would put them well within striking range of Iran.""You would be able to maintain a sustained operation from [Diego Garcia] far more efficiently,"" Air Marshall Greg Bagwell - a former RAF deputy operations chief - told BBC Verify. ""You could literally have them round the clock operating.""Satellite images first showed B-2 bombers had been stationed on Diego Garcia at the end of March, but the most recent imagery from the island no longer shows the bombers present.Vice-Admiral Mellet said he would expect to see the bombers on the island ahead of any operation targeting Iran and called their absence ""a missing piece of the jigsaw"".Air Marshall Bagwell agreed. But he noted that B-2s have been known to operate for 24 hours at a time and could launch from the continental US if the White House decided to launch a strike.""They've taken away any means for Iran to now defend itself, which obviously leaves any military or even the nuclear targets pretty much at the mercy of whatever Israel wants to do to it.""Additional reporting by Merlyn Thomas.

'What should we do?' Seeking clarity in Tehran as Israeli jets fly overhead,"Fear and stress are evident in my sister's voice in Tehran, despite the crackling, intermittent WhatsApp connection that - miraculously - still works from time to time.Clarity is what she wants from me, knowing I am a journalist with the BBC in London.""What is going to happen? What should we do?"" she asks. US President Donald Trump has said people in Tehran should evacuate. ""Is he serious?""Since Thursday night, Tehran has come under repeated bombardment by Israeli planes, which seem to be flying freely across the skies of the capital. They are met by anti-aircraft fire – which is mostly ineffective.From her window on the upper floors of a high-rise building, my sister can clearly see the action, which does little to calm her nerves.The Israeli military has ordered people in her district - stretching for several kilometres in all directions - to evacuate. But she has chosen to stay.She told me that, as far as she knew, there were no military-type targets near her apartment block.Still, she was concerned about a nearby commercial unit - owned, she believed, by the Revolutionary Guards - which might be a target. She had no idea what the company actually did.Many people do not know who their neighbours are or whether military targets are nearby, since much of the Revolutionary Guards' activity is conducted secretly and from hidden locations.Electricity and water are still available in many parts of the capital, but food supplies are running low.Many shops have closed, and more are shutting their doors. Even bakeries are closing – some due to lack of flour, others likely because the owners have fled.My sister has refused to leave the city, unlike the hundreds of thousands - perhaps millions - who already have, mostly because she has nowhere to go.In spite of jam-packed roads and petrol shortages, many residents have fled in recent days.The streets of Tehran, once chock-a-block with traffic, are now eerily quiet.Those who remain barely venture out, fearing attacks.Recent reports suggest the long queues at petrol stations have begun to ease, and the roads out of the capital are less congested.Residents living near the country's nuclear facilities face the additional fear of the spread of radioactive contamination, as these sites have been targeted repeatedly by Israeli strikes in recent days. The global nuclear watchdog has so far said the levels of radioactivity outside two sites which were attacked and damaged on Friday are unchanged.People are asking where all this will lead, and how long it will last.Many now rely on Persian-language TV channels based abroad for news.BBC Persian's TV service and its website have become key sources. Web traffic from inside Iran has doubled almost overnight, despite the internet being painfully slow most of the time.Trump has called for Iran's surrender, but Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has just declared that Iran will not surrender.Few Iranians sympathise with the regime, but many fear that chaos and lawlessness could follow if it is significantly destabilised.Copyright 2025 BBC.

'Taxi boats' pick up migrants in waist-deep water as Channel smugglers switch tactics,"As the weather in the Channel clears, the French police are struggling to halt a potentially record-breaking surge of people from reaching the UK in small boats organised by a growing network of smuggling gangs. Downing Street said on Tuesday the situation was ""deteriorating.""Although the French authorities claim they're now intercepting more than two thirds of those boats before they reach the sea, the smugglers are now changing tactics to launch so-called ""taxi boats"" from new sites, in new ways, and with ever greater speed.Instead of inflating their boats in the dunes along the coast, close to police patrols, the gangs are launching them from better hidden locations, often dozens of kilometres from the main departure beaches. They then cruise along the coastline, like taxis or buses, picking up their paying customers who now wait in the sea, out of reach of the police.Just before sunrise last Friday, we encountered a group of perhaps 80 people gathered in calm, waist-deep water, off a beach near the village of Wissant, south of Calais. There were several women and children in the group, from countries including Eritrea and Afghanistan.We counted 18 French gendarmes watching them from the shore, declining to intervene.An inflatable taxi boat, operated by a smuggling gang, had just arrived by sea and now circled repeatedly. Over the course of perhaps 10 minutes, one man sitting at the front of the boat appeared to usher people forwards, to clamber onboard in relatively organised, even orderly, groups.Several children clung, occasionally crying, to their relatives' shoulders.""Yes, to England,"" one Afghan man told me, patiently waiting his turn, his eyes focused firmly on the boat.The taxi boat system appears to give the smugglers a little more control over what has often been a chaotic and dangerous process, involving large crowds dragging boats to the water and then scrambling on board. A little over a year ago, I watched the result on a nearby beach when about 100 migrants tried to pile onto the same boat. Five people, including a seven-year-old girl, were trampled or suffocated to death.On Friday morning, Colonel Olivier Alary stood, dry-footed, watching the taxi boat load up. He explained that the current operational rules for his forces were clear. They would intervene to rescue someone if they were about to drown. They might even attempt to stop the boat if it became trapped on a sandbank. But it was simply too risky, for all involved, for the police to try to reach the boat now that it was afloat.""The police will be able to do more… if the rules governing our actions at sea are changed,"" said Alary, referring to the French government's declared intention to revise those rules.The government has since confirmed there are plans to unveil new guidelines next month which would enable its police to intervene more forcefully with small boats in shallow waters.The BBC understands a new ""maritime doctrine"" would allow special squads to intercept migrant dinghies up to 300 metres from the shoreline.""It's essential that we don't create panic and endanger these people further. If the rules change to allow us to intervene against these taxi boats, as close as possible to the shore, then we'll be able… to be more effective,"" said Alary, as the fully loaded boat finally set off north-westwards, towards the English coast.Although some officers say there is already a bit of wiggle-room for the police in terms of how strictly they interpret the existing rules, many are fearful that they might face serious legal trouble.""I can understand an average British person watching this on television might say, 'Damn, those police don't want to intervene.' But it's not like that. Imagine people on a boat panic and we end up with children drowning. The police officer who intervened would end up in a French court. It's a complicated business, but we can't fence off the entire coastline. It's not the Second World War,"" said Marc Musiol, of the police union, Unity.""If we don't have the orders, we don't move. Even if there's one centimetre of water, we don't intervene. It's frustrating,"" said his union colleague, Marc Alegre.As a result, the French forces, now patrolling more than 120km (75 miles) of coastline in northern France, focus all their attention on trying to intercept the smugglers' boats before they launch.And while that interception rate is rising, the smugglers are changing their own tactics fast.We'd first joined Colonel Alary and his men soon after midnight on Friday. It was the fourth full night our team had spent on the beaches in recent weeks. Alary's unit was busy using infra-red drones, paid for by the British government, to spot and track several hundred migrants who'd gathered in smaller groups along the coast, having arrived by bus and on foot over the course of Thursday afternoon and evening. On a monitor, we could clearly see one group, gathered around a makeshift campfire in a forest near the beach.""But it's the smugglers we're after. If we move towards the migrants now, they'll just disperse,"" said Alary.Then, at around five in the morning, to the visible frustration of the police, reports came in of a successful taxi boat launch further up the coast.""Let's go,"" said Alary.Some minutes later, we arrived at a shingle beach beside the old fishing village of Audresselles, just south of Cap Gris-Nez. A black Volvo V50, doors open, was stuck fast up to its axles in pebbles.The car had clearly been driven at high speed across the main road and straight towards the sea.""They're adapting, again,"" said Colonel Olivier Alary, inspecting the black cords that the smuggling gang had used to tie a large inflatable boat, precariously, to the Volvo's roof.The smugglers had evidently inflated the boat in a shed or farm building close by, then driven it the short distance to the beach, untied it, dragged it the last few metres to the water, and were safely on their way within a matter of seconds. Heading north, they would collect their paying passengers from other points along the coast much like bus or a taxi – hence the ""taxi boat"" nickname.""This is the third time it's happened in this area,"" grumbled Alary, of an emerging new tactic used by the smugglers.The police, armed with night-vision binoculars and drones, have become skilled at spotting the moment the smugglers start to inflate their rubber boats. This normally happens in the dunes and forests on the coast or beside rivers and canals. It is a period of maximum vulnerability for the gangs and their clients. Using up to six electric pumps per boat, the smugglers can often finish the job in less than 15 minutes. But the inflated boats are large, unwieldy, and hard to move by hand.The police often have time to intercept the inflatables before they're dragged towards the water, usually by a dozen or more people. Officers, sometimes using pepper spray and stun grenades to clear a path, then slash the boats with knives to render them unusable. The BBC has seen police body-cam footage showing people hurling rocks at officers and even holding a young child in front of the police to try to stop them.According to the French police, the gangs – which we understand are now growing in number in the Calais area as demand for crossings increases – have not only begun inflating their boats in secrecy, hidden in buildings close to the beaches, but have threatened local farmers who have objected to their presence.While some of these taxi boat launches – designed to exploit the French police's unwillingness to intervene at sea – take place close to the main migrant departure areas around Calais and Boulogne, some boats are now setting off from much further away.On Friday morning, Alary told us, there had just been a successful taxi boat launch from Cayeux-Sur-Mer, a village about 100km south beyond the river Somme. He anticipated that it would arrive here around noon and start trying to pick up passengers near Boulogne.One unintended consequence of the smuggler's growing dependence on the taxi boat system is that it gives young men an advantage over women and children, who often struggle to climb on board from the sea.""I've tried [to cross] 12 times now,"" said Luna, a Somali woman from Mogadishu. She described incidents of police violence on the beaches and the experience of being left behind while men clambered onto the boats.""Sometimes the police are very violent. I've been hit myself. They put tear gas – something in the air – you can't breathe. Sometimes the boat is very far [out to sea]. That's why women and children are left behind so many times. It's so dangerous, so risky. We cannot swim. I don't want to die,"" Luna said, as she waited for a meal at an informal migrant camp near Dunkirk. She added that after one and a half months trying to complete the journey to the UK, she had no plans to quit.Meanwhile, having failed to stop the taxi boat launch on the shingle beach at Audresselles, Colonel Alary was not yet ready to give up either.""Let's go. The boat is going north towards Cap Griz Nez. We're going to try to intercept them,"" he said, as his team rushed towards their cars.While we followed the police, we could see the boat – a thin black smudge on a milky sea – to our left. But by the time we'd got to Wissant, 15 minutes later, it was already too late. The migrants were in the water, and the taxi boat was already half full.All in all, it had not been a good night for the French police. Alary's forces claimed four successful interceptions on land. But along the whole coast, a total of 14 boats had made it to sea, carrying 919 people to the UK.Later that morning, on a brief trip to sea on a police patrol boat, Colonel Alary reflected on the battle to stop the smugglers. There were so many challenges – from the heavy equipment worn by police which made it dangerous for them to enter the water safely, to the inherent instability of the inflatable boats, which made them too vulnerable to stop at sea without risk of drownings.But Alary said the UK itself held the key to solving this crisis.""It should be kept in mind that 30% of all the migrants entering the European Union end up here, in the Calais area. They travel from all over Europe to come here… because the United Kingdom is attracting them. England is attractive. It encourages migrants to want to join it. The solution is to make England less attractive, then people would remain [at home or in the EU].""That belief - in the UK's magnetic pull for migrants – remains the conventional wisdom among both French officials and many of those risking their lives to cross the Channel.On a much windier day last week, on a beach beside an old Bourbon-era fort in the village of Ambleteuse, I met a former fisherman, Stéphane Pinto, who is now the local mayor.""For migrants, the UK is still seen as an El Dorado. The British need to address this issue more forcefully,"" he said. If it didn't, Pinto warned of growing violence between police, local communities, and a rising wave of migration from an increasingly troubled world.""This is no longer just a problem linked to dictatorship or war. It is growing due to what's happening globally: climate change, the collapse of economies in some countries, and so on. We feel there is a new wave growing today, and unless we really tackle it, we will sadly only be spectators of what will happen in the coming years.""Copyright 2025 BBC.

Kenyan 'miracle babies' pastor dies in road crash,"Controversial Kenyan televangelist Gilbert Deya, who claimed he created miraculous pregnancies, has died in a road crash.Police told local media that Deya died on the spot on Tuesday evening after his vehicle was involved in an accident with a university bus and another vehicle near the town of Kisumu in western Kenya.At least 30 other people were reportedly injured, including a person identified as his wife and a passenger in his vehicle, and 15 students in the bus.Deya, who ran a church in London, rose to infamy in the early 2000s, following his claim that he could help infertile couples conceive ""miracle"" babies through prayer.Investigations later linked his church to an alleged child-trafficking ring, leading to his arrest and extradition from the UK eight years ago after a decade-long legal battle. He was acquitted of the charges in 2023 due to insufficient evidence.On Wednesday, Siaya County Governor James Orengo said he had learnt with ""deep sorrow and regret of the passing on of Bishop Gilbert Deya"".He confirmed that the ""horrific"" road accident had involved a vehicle belonging to the county.Photos shared online showed the mangled wreckage of one of the vehicles, which was completely shattered in the accident.A former stonemason-turned evangelist, Deya moved from Kenya to London in the mid-1990s, where he founded Gilbert Deya Ministries, a registered charity with branches across the UK and Africa.He was known for his charismatic preaching style and claimed to have been consecrated as an archbishop by a US evangelist in 1992.His ministries later faced multiple investigations by the UK authorities for alleged mismanagement and legal violations, including selling olive oil which were falsely claiming to have healing properties.He was once described by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, then an MP, as a ""modern-day snake-oil salesman who has conned and betrayed his vulnerable congregation"".At his church, desperate women, some past their menopause and others who were unable to conceive, would be convinced that they would become pregnant through prayer.But the babies were always ""delivered"" in backstreet clinics in Kenya's capital, Nairobi. The prosecution said the babies were stolen from poor Kenyan families.In 2011, his then wife Mary Deya was jailed after being found guilty of stealing a baby from the main referral hospital in Nairobi and falsely stating she had given birth to the baby.Deya would later tell a court that they had divorced after she had been charged, saying she had ""tarnished"" his name. Recent videos from the YouTube page of Gilbert Deya Ministries appear to show him announcing that he has a new wife, Diana Deya. When the televangelist was asked in a BBC investigation in 2014 how the alleged ""miracle"" children had different DNA to that of their alleged parents, he said it was ""beyond human imagination"".""It is not something I can say. I can explain because they are of God and things of God cannot be explained by a human being,"" he said.After his acquittal in 2023, Deya continued with his religious outreach programmes until his death, reportedly at 72.Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.Follow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaCopyright 2025 BBC.
